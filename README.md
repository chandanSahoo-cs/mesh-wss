# Mesh WebSocket Server

A lightweight WebSocket server built with **Node.js** and the **`ws`** library to power real-time user presence for the [Mesh App](https://mesh-ochre.vercel.app/).

 - **Heartbeat System**  
  Detects dead connections and cleans up stale sessionsâ€”especially useful in unreliable network conditions or abrupt tab/browser closes.
- **Multi-tab Aware**  
  Supports multiple tabs per user, with smart deduplication to ensure only active sessions are maintained.
